												<h2>I see you're here to learn about my <strong>Price Comparison Web Scraper</strong>, 
													<i><strong>Alex's Tools</strong></i>.
												</h2>
											</header>
											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<h3>The App</h3>
											<p><i>Alex's Tools </i>is a price comparison web scraping application that allows
												users to search and track the prices of their favorite products from 
												sites such as Amazon.com and HomeDepot.com. Users can opt to receive email alerts
												when items that they wish to track drop in price, allowing them to purchase
												their items for the best deal.
											</p>											
											<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
											<p>I came up with the application idea when I was spending time with a
												close friend--<strong>Alex</strong>. He's an apprentice electrician who
												is always looking at new tools. He spent so much time switching between
												websites, trying to find the best prices, shipping deals, and coupon codes.
												I knew this process could be more straightforward, and I wanted to find
												a way to make that a reality. After all, doesn't technology exist to solve problems
												and make life easier? So I went into the drafting stage.</p>											
											<h3>The Challenges</h3>
											<p>The first challenge was figuring out the structure and design
												of the application: What framework would I use? What are my use cases?
												What will set my application apart from other existing apps and extensions? I
												spent a long time in this drafting stage, leading me to think outside the box
												and anticipate my audience's needs. Next, I faced the challenge of developing
												the code for the application, designing and implementing my UI, and
												testing and editing constantly. At times, I felt like a jack of all
												trades, trying to do a little bit of everything since I was the only one
												working on the project, and other times, I felt like the master of none.
												However, the frustration in the latter experiences fueled my fire for growth
												and helped me learn new skills and improve old ones. This project has indeed
												been a unique creative experience.</p>
											<h3>Future of Alex's Tools</h3>
											<p>Some features that I would like to implement are a user sign-in feature to
												allow users to keep track of their purchases and manage their notification
												settings. Additionally, I would like for my application to be able to handle data
												from a greater selection of websites. Ideally, this application would one day
												hold a variety of products in its database already, thus allowing users to search
												the product list of scraped data as opposed to entering a link to scrape the data.
